## v0.2.0 Requirements

Requirements for navigation improvements and mock data seeding.

### Navigation

- [x] **NAV-01**: Hamburger menu component displays next to logo on desktop
- [x] **NAV-02**: Hamburger menu contains grouped sections (Browse / Account / Provider)
- [x] **NAV-03**: Hamburger menu includes Browse Services, Categories, Dashboard, Messages, Orders, My Gigs, Help links
- [x] **NAV-04**: Hamburger menu auto-closes when user navigates to a new page
- [x] **NAV-05**: User dropdown menu appears when clicking avatar in header
- [x] **NAV-06**: User dropdown displays username/email and avatar
- [x] **NAV-07**: User dropdown includes Profile, Settings, and Sign Out links
- [x] **NAV-08**: User dropdown includes provider mode indicator for users with isProvider=true
- [x] **NAV-09**: User dropdown closes when clicking outside the menu
- [x] **NAV-10**: Navigation components maintain Server/Client boundary (Header stays Server Component)
- [x] **NAV-11**: Menu items render conditionally based on authentication state
- [x] **NAV-12**: Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape) for accessibility

### Mock Data Infrastructure

- [x] **SEED-01**: Install @faker-js/faker as dev dependency
- [x] **SEED-02**: Configure Prisma seed command in prisma.config.ts
- [x] **SEED-03**: Create prisma/seed.ts with TypeScript support
- [x] **SEED-04**: Implement idempotent upsert pattern for all seed data
- [x] **SEED-05**: Implement proper cleanup order (reviews → orders → gigs → users)
- [x] **SEED-06**: Configure deterministic seeding with faker.seed() for reproducibility

### Mock Data Content

- [x] **SEED-07**: Generate 10-15 complete provider profiles with all User schema fields
- [x] **SEED-08**: Use realistic names from Faker.js with locale awareness
- [x] **SEED-09**: Generate deterministic avatar URLs using DiceBear API
- [x] **SEED-10**: Distribute providers across all 13 service categories
- [x] **SEED-11**: Include diverse representation in provider demographics
- [x] **SEED-12**: Generate 1-3 gigs per provider with category-appropriate content
- [x] **SEED-13**: Use realistic pricing tiers (Basic/Standard/Premium) per category
- [x] **SEED-14**: Add portfolio images using Lorem Picsum API
- [x] **SEED-15**: Create completed orders as foundation for reviews
- [x] **SEED-16**: Generate 3-8 reviews per provider with varied content
- [x] **SEED-17**: Implement rating variance (3.5-5.0 range, bell curve distribution)
- [x] **SEED-18**: Vary review length and writing style for realism
- [x] **SEED-19**: Spread timestamps across realistic time periods
- [x] **SEED-20**: Update provider averageRating and totalReviews aggregates

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones.

### Production Readiness
- Real payment integration (Stripe Connect)
- Cloud storage migration (S3, Cloudinary)
- Email notifications for critical events
- Production deployment infrastructure

### Feature Enhancements
- Location-based search and filtering
- Provider portfolios with work samples
- Availability calendar for scheduling
- Advanced search filters
- Favorites/saved providers
- Skill verification badges

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v0.2.0.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Notification badges in navigation | Requires real-time infrastructure (polling/websockets) |
| Persistent bottom navigation bar | Not critical for desktop-first focus |
| Service-specific detail templates | Diminishing returns on realism, requires deep domain expertise |
| Real user recruitment | Mock data sufficient for development/demo purposes |
| Mega-menus or multi-level navigation | Over-engineering for current feature set |
