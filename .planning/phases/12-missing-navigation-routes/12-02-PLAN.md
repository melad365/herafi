<objective>
Human verification of completed navigation routes and authentication testing.

Purpose: Ensure all navigation gaps are closed, routes render correctly, and seed user authentication enables full testing of authenticated flows.

Output: Confirmation that v0.2.0 milestone navigation is complete and functional.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Five new navigation routes (/categories, /help, /profile, /settings, /provider/gigs) and seed user authentication with bcrypt passwords.

**Routes created:**
1. /categories - Category browse grid with all 13 categories and gig counts
2. /help - Help and support information page with buyer/provider sections
3. /profile - Smart redirect to user's public profile or profile edit
4. /settings - Account settings page with account info and provider status
5. /provider/gigs - Provider gig management page with full gig list

**Authentication enabled:**
- All 19 seed users now have bcrypt-hashed passwords
- Test credentials: provider1@herafi-seed.test / password123
- Can test all authenticated flows (dashboard, orders, messages, provider features)
  </what-built>

  <how-to-verify>
**1. Verify routes exist (no 404s):**
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/categories
     - ✓ Page loads without 404
     - ✓ Displays "Browse by Category" header
     - ✓ Shows grid of 13 category cards
     - ✓ Each card shows category name and gig count
     - ✓ Cards link to /gigs?category=CATEGORY_VALUE

   - Visit http://localhost:3000/help
     - ✓ Page loads without 404
     - ✓ Displays "Help & Support" header
     - ✓ Shows three sections: For Buyers, For Providers, Contact Support
     - ✓ Contains helpful content about using Herafi

   - Visit http://localhost:3000/profile (must be logged in)
     - ✓ Redirects appropriately (to /u/username or /profile/edit)
     - ✓ No 404 error

   - Visit http://localhost:3000/settings (must be logged in)
     - ✓ Page loads without 404
     - ✓ Displays "Account Settings" header
     - ✓ Shows account information, provider status, danger zone sections

   - Visit http://localhost:3000/provider/gigs (must be logged in as provider)
     - ✓ Page loads without 404
     - ✓ Displays "My Gigs" header with count
     - ✓ Shows list of all provider's gigs
     - ✓ Each gig has View and Edit buttons

**2. Test navigation integration:**
   - Click hamburger menu (Bars3Icon next to logo)
   - Click "Categories" link
     - ✓ Navigates to /categories (no 404)
     - ✓ Menu auto-closes

   - Click hamburger menu again
   - Click "Help" link
     - ✓ Navigates to /help (no 404)
     - ✓ Menu auto-closes

   - Click user avatar dropdown (top-right)
   - Click "Profile" link
     - ✓ Navigates without 404
     - ✓ Dropdown closes

   - Click user avatar dropdown again
   - Click "Settings" link
     - ✓ Navigates to /settings (no 404)
     - ✓ Dropdown closes

   - (If logged in as provider) Click hamburger menu
   - Click "My Gigs" link in Provider section
     - ✓ Navigates to /provider/gigs (no 404)
     - ✓ Menu auto-closes

**3. Test seed user authentication:**
   - Sign out if currently logged in
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Enter credentials:
     - Email: provider1@herafi-seed.test
     - Password: password123
   - Click "Sign in"
     - ✓ Login succeeds (no error message)
     - ✓ Redirected to dashboard
     - ✓ Header shows user avatar and hamburger menu

   - Test authenticated features:
     - Visit /dashboard → ✓ Shows user's dashboard
     - Visit /orders → ✓ Shows orders list
     - Visit /messages → ✓ Shows messages
     - Visit /provider/dashboard → ✓ Shows provider dashboard
     - Visit /provider/gigs → ✓ Shows gig management page

   - Try another seed user:
     - Sign out
     - Log in with buyer1@herafi-seed.test / password123
     - ✓ Login succeeds
     - Visit /provider/gigs → ✓ Redirects to /provider/setup (not a provider)

**4. Visual/UX checks:**
   - /categories page:
     - ✓ Responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)
     - ✓ Cards have hover effects
     - ✓ Follows burgundy design system
     - ✓ Gig counts are accurate

   - /help page:
     - ✓ Content is readable and well-structured
     - ✓ Links to related pages work (/provider/setup, /gigs)
     - ✓ Follows existing page layout patterns

   - /settings page:
     - ✓ Account information displays correctly
     - ✓ Provider status badge shows correctly
     - ✓ Danger zone section is visually distinct (red styling)

   - /provider/gigs page:
     - ✓ Gig list matches gigs from dashboard but shows ALL gigs
     - ✓ View and Edit buttons work
     - ✓ Empty state shows if no gigs
     - ✓ Create New Gig button prominent

**5. Cross-reference with audit:**
   - Open .planning/v0.2.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md
   - Check gaps.routes section:
     - ✓ /categories - CLOSED
     - ✓ /help - CLOSED
     - ✓ /profile - CLOSED
     - ✓ /settings - CLOSED
     - ✓ /provider/gigs - CLOSED
   - Check gaps.auth section:
     - ✓ Seed users can log in - CLOSED

**Expected results:**
- All 5 routes accessible (HTTP 200)
- All navigation links work (no 404 errors)
- Login with seed users succeeds
- All authenticated pages accessible after login
- Visual design consistent with existing pages
- No console errors
  </how-to-verify>

  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all verification steps pass, or describe any issues found (broken links, 404s, styling problems, auth failures, etc.)
  </resume-signal>
